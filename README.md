# digit_recognition
Neural network that distinguishes between handwritten numbers, created using keras
The main file contains the necessary imports, as well as from where the change function is called into which the path to the file with the 28x28 pixel image
is passed. In the drawing file, a program written with pygame that allows you to draw numbers and immediately let the model distinguish between them.
First download all files, then install required modules from requirements.txt.
You can do this with two commands:
1. git clone https://github.com/Timon69/digit_recognition.git
2. pip install requirements.txt 
P.S. The program is completely written in python, but for some reason the github defines a different language
